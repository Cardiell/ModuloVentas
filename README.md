# Proyecto Mabamex

This program is a project carried out for the process engineering class in which we had to observe the process of a company, in our case we observe the Mabamex process,
We carry out 4 modules for this project:

- Sales module.
- Purchasing module.
- Purchasing manager module.
- Operation module.

The one I present below is the sales module:

The operation module was carried out with:

- Atmega328p.
- Tsc3200 color sensor
- Stepper motor.
- Phototransistor
- Infrared diode.
- Servomotor.

Our project consisted of an assembly band in which each time a material with a valid color was detected, the value of the correct counter in our database increased by one; otherwise, the incorrect value increased by one; If there was an error, the servomor was activated. When moving to a waste container, the sales module obtains all this information so that the list of available material is always updated.
